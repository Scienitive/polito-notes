- If $f = o(1)$ as $x \to c$, that is $\lim_{x \to c}f(x) = 0$. Then:
	- $f$ is called **infinitesimal** at c.
- If $1 = o(f)$ as $x \to c$, that is $\lim_{x \to c}f(x) = \pm \infty$. Then:
	- $f$ is called **infinite** at c.

### Let $f$, $g$ be two infinitesimals at c:
- $f \asymp g$ as $x \to c$:
	-  $f$ and $g$ infinitesimals of same order.
- $f = o(g)$ as $x \to c$:
	- $f$ is infinitesimal of bigger order than $g$.
- $g = o(f)$ as $x \to c$:
	- $f$ is infinitesimal of smaller order than $g$.
- If none of the above is true:
	- $f$ and $g$ are non-comparable infinitesimals.
