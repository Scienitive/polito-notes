## Definition
$$
m(f,a,b) = \frac{1}{b-a}\int_a^bf(x)dx
$$
This is the *integral mean value* of $f$ over $[a, b]$.
So in other way:
$$
\int_a^bf(x)dx = (b-a)\cdot m(f,a,b)
$$
And the right side of this equation is simply area of a rectangle:

So what $m(f,a,b)$ is the $f$ that is flattened and preserved it's area as a rectangle.

**NOTE:** Also we should note that the $m(f,a,b) = f(c)$ for some $c$ value. So we can express the area of $f$ with some $c$ like $f(c)\cdot(b-a)$.
However for this note to be true $f$ should be a *continuous*.
