## Definition
$$
p(x) = \ell \varphi^{a}(x)
$$
$\ell$ is the limit, $\varphi(x)$ is the test function, $a$ is the order.

## What to Do
$$
\lim_{x \to c}\frac{f(x)}{\varphi^a(x)} = \ell
$$
When finding the order and the principal part of a function, one must start from the above limit.

If there is a number $a$ for which such limit $\ell$ is finite and non-zero then $a$ is the required order with respect to the test function and principal part is $\varphi^{a}(x)$.
## Test Function
Generally you can take the test function as $x$. So $\varphi(x) = x$.
