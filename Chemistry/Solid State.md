### Crystalline and Amorphous Solids

**NOTE:** Transparent solids are generally amorphous solids.
### Types of Solids

#### Ionic Solids
An ionic solid is a solid that consists of cations and anions held together by electrical attraction of opposite charges (ionic bond).

#### Molecular Solid
A molecular solid is a solid that consists of atoms or molecules held together by intermolecular forces.
- Many solids are of this type.
- Examples include solid neon, solid water (ice), and solid carbon dioxide (dry ice).
- Their physical properties depend on the strengths of those forces.
#### Covalent Network Solid
A covalent network solid is a solid that consists of atoms held together in large networks or chains by covalent bonds.
- Examples include carbon, in its forms as diamond or graphite, asbestos, and silicon carbide.
- Network solids are typically hard and rigid; they have high melting and boiling points. Ceramic materials are commonly network solids.
#### Metallic Solid
A metallic solid is a solid that consists of positive cores of atoms held together by a surrounding “sea” of electrons (metallic bonding).
- In this kind of bonding, positively charged atomic cores are surrounded by delocalized electrons.
- Examples include iron, copper, and silver.
### Crystals and Crystal Lattices
We do not have to draw the complete crystal lattice every time we want to convey the structure of a solid. The regular repeating lattice structure allows us to focus our attention on a representative small region of the crystal.

**Unit Cell**, the smallest unit that, when stacked together repeatedly without any gaps and without rotations, can reproduce the entire crystal.
All crystal structures can be expressed in terms of only *14* basic patterns of unit cells called *Bravais lattices*.
### Bravais Lattices

The most important ones are:
- Simple Cubic (The "primitive" cubic cell)
- Body-Centered Cubic
- Face-Centered Cubic
- Hexagonal
#### Simple Cubic
- Coordination Number: $6$
- Atoms per Unit Cell: $1$

#### Body-Centered Cubic
- Coordination Number: $8$
- Atoms per Unit Cell: $2$

#### Face-Centered Cubic
- Coordination Number: $12$
- Atoms per Unit Cell: $4$
- $A - B - C$ Layer

#### Hexagonal
- Coordination Number: $12$
- Atoms per Unit Cell: $4$
- $A - B - A$ Layer

### Ionic Crystals
Ionic crystals have a big *anion* and a small *cation*. So when the anions form a bravais lattice they also create some *gaps* that some cations can fit in. We call those "gaps" *interstices*.
#### Types of Interstices
![[Pasted image 20231218235255.png]]
Based on the *radius ratio* the interstices have different shapes. This makes ionic crystals to form differently.

### Allotropy and Polymorphism
#### Allotropy
When an element can exist in different forms, we call those form *allotropes*.

#### Polymorphism
When a substance (non elemental) has different crystal forms.
