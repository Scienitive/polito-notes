## Intra- and Inter-Molecular Forces
![[Pasted image 20231218023229.png]]
- *Intra-Molecular Forces* are the forces inside a molecule, between the elements.
- *Inter-Molecular Forces* are the forces between two molecules.
Inter-Molecular forces are responsible for the existence of several different *phases* of matter. A phase is a form of matter that is uniform throughout in both chemical composition and physical state (solid, liquid, and gas (or vapor)).

Inter-Molecular Force's Energy:
$$
E_p \propto \frac{c}{r^n}
$$
$c$ is a constant, $r$ is distance and $n$ changes every type of inter-molecular interaction.

- Blue line represents *Intra-Molecular* interactions.
- Red line represents *Inter-Molecular* interactions.
### Ion-Dipole Forces
- Water molecules are held together in the liquid phase by *inter-molecular interactions*.
- When an ionic solid is added to water, a number of water molecules can surround each ion on the surface of the solid, separate it from the other ions, and progressively dissolve it.
![[Pasted image 20231218024146.png]]
So basically, in a polar molecule (like water) there is a slightly positive and slightly negative charged regions. And that regions attract cations and anions just like in the above figure.
### Dipole-Dipole Attraction
- Polar molecules contain different atoms which have different electronegativity and can be thought to be like a small bar magnet.
![[Pasted image 20231218024516.png]]
So basically, you can think of a polar molecule as a small magnet that has a positive and a negative side. And when multiple magnets are in the place they attract and repulse each other.
### Dipole-Dipole Forces
Dipole-Dipole Forces are the same as Dipole-Dipole Attraction in principle but this one is for *gasses*.
Also it's much weaker than Dipole-Dipole Attraction.
### Hydrogen Bonding
- *Strongest* among all inter-molecular interactions.
- A type of dipole-dipole interactions.
When $F$, $O$ or $N$ atoms create a bond with $H$, we get *hydrogen bonding* there.
This is a very strong inter-molecular interaction because of the difference in *electronegativity* between $H$ and the other element is very high. So the magnet effect is much more stronger than the other type of interactions.

### London Dispersion Forces
Attractive interactions are found even between non-polar molecules.
Electrons may accumulate in one part of a molecule leaving a fleeting partial negative charge on one region and fleeting partial positive charge on another region;
![[Pasted image 20231218025820.png]]
- It is the *weakest* inter-molecular force.
- It is present on every type of molecule.
**NOTE:** London interactions strengthens going *down* the group.
### Dipole-Induced Dipole Interactions
- Closely related to London Interactions.
- Occurs when a polar molecule interacts with a non-polar molecule:
![[Pasted image 20231218030445.png]]
- Like the London interaction, the dipole–induced dipole interaction arises from the ability of one molecule to induce a dipole moment in the other.
- However, in this case, the molecule that induces the dipole moment has a permanent dipole moment.
### Ion-Induced Dipole Interactions
- Again, closely related to London Interactions.
- Occurs when a ion molecule (like a Cation or an Anion) interacts with a non-polar molecule.
### Overview
![[Pasted image 20231218030916.png]]
## The Liquid State
- In the liquid state the particles are randomly arranged (like in a gas).
- The particles are closer to each other than in gases so the density of liquids is greater than that of gases.
- Liquids adopt the shape of the container into which they are placed.
- Unlike gases *liquids have a fixed volume and density*. This is because they have greater attractive forces between particles holding them close together.
### Surface Tension
- The surface of a liquid is smooth because intermolecular forces tend to pull the molecules together and inward, *the surface tension is the net inward pull*.
- Surface tension decreases as the temperature rises and the interactions between molecules are overcome by the increased molecular motion.
### Vapour Pressure
The vapor pressure of a substance is the pressure exerted by its vapor when the vapor is in dynamic equilibrium with the condensed phase.
![[Pasted image 20231218031524.png]]

Liquids with high vapor pressures at ordinary temperatures are said to be *volatile*.
- High vapour pressure $\to$ Weak inter-molecular forces in the liquid
- Low vapour pressure $\to$ Strong inter-molecular forces in the liquid
**NOTE:** The vapor pressure of a liquid increases as the temperature increases.
**NOTE:** When the vapor pressure matches the external pressure, the liquid *boils*.
### Melting and Freezing
The freezing temperature, the temperature at which the solid and liquid phases are in dynamic equilibrium.
In practice, a liquid sometimes does not freeze until the temperature is a few degrees below its freezing point $\to$ *supercooled*.
### Phase Diagram (Important!)
It's also called *state diagram*.
![[Pasted image 20231218145401.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231218145549.png]]
**Important NOTE:** For example we can say that *water's phase diagram* looks like the left graph because the liquid is more dense than the solid form.

- **Triple Point** is the only state where 3 phases can co-exist together.
- **Critical Point** is where the liquid and gas phases merge and can't be differentiated anymore. After that point we call the phase of the substance *supercritical fluid*.
## Solutions
A solution is an homogenous mixture of atoms, molecules or ions distributed in the whole space.
There are three types of solutions:
- Gas mixtures
- Liquid solutions
- Solid solutions
![[Pasted image 20231218150920.png]]
### How does a Solution Form
The ions are *solvated* (surrounded by solvent).
If the solvent is water, the ions are *hydrated*.
### Electrolyte
- *Non-electrolyte:* Dissolves in water, does not breaks up into ions.
- *Electrolyte:* Dissolves in water, breaks up into ions.
### Energy Changes in Solution
The change in molar enthalpy when a substance dissolves is called the *enthalpy of solution* $\Delta H_{sol}$

To determine the enthalpy change, we divide the process into 3 steps:
1) Separation of solute particles.
2) Separation of solvent particles to make "holes".
3) Formation of new interactions between solute and solvent.
![[Pasted image 20231218152355.png]]

Another approach for *ionic compounds*, involves the combination of lattice enthalpy and hydration enthalpy:
1) First step, the ions are separated from the solid to form a gas of ions (lattice enthalpy).
2) In the second hypothetical step, the gaseous ions plunge into water forming the final solution. The molar enthalpy of this step is called the *enthalpy of hydration*.

### Gibbs Free Energy and Entropy of a Solution
#### Gibbs Free Energy
Given the $T$ and $P$ of the system:
- $\Delta G < 0 \to$ The process is *spontaneous*.
- $\Delta G > 0 \to$ The process is not spontaneous.
- $\Delta G = 0 \to$ The process is at *equilibrium*.
#### Entropy
Entropy is a measure of number of micro states (arrangements) in the system.
Because of this every solution has a greater entropy than it's not solution form.
**For formation of solutions $\Delta S > 0$ always!**
### Dissolution vs Reaction
*Dissolution* is a physical change, you can get back the original solute by evaporating the solvent.
If you can't get back to the original solute then it means the substance didn't dissolved, it *reacted*.
### Factors Affecting Solubility
**Like dissolves like!**
- Polar substances tend to dissolve in polar substances.
- Non-polar substances tend to dissolve in non-polar substances.
![[Pasted image 20231218155451.png]]

The cleaning action of soaps and detergents relies on the like-dissolves-like rule.
![[Pasted image 20231218155553.png]]
Because the hydrophilic head group of the anion is able to dissolve in water and the hydrophobic hydrocarbon tails are able to dissolve in grease, soap is very effective at removing grease.
![[Pasted image 20231218155639.png]]
### Degree of Saturation
#### Saturated Solution
- Solvent holds as much solute as is possible at that temperature.
- Undissolved solid remains in flask.
- Dissolved solute is in dynamic equilibrium with solid solute particles.
#### Unsaturated Solution
- Less than the maximum amount of solute for that temperature is dissolved in the solvent.
- No solid remains in flask.
#### Supersaturated Solution
- Solvent holds *more* solute than is normally possible at that temperature.
- These solutions are unstable; crystallization can often be stimulated by adding a “seed crystal” or scratching the side of the flask.
![[Pasted image 20231218160106.png]]
### Gasses in Solution
- The solubility of *liquids* and *solids* does not change appreciable with *pressure*.
- But, the solubility of a *gas* in a liquid is directly proportional to its *pressure*.
#### Henry's Law
$$
S_g = kP_g
$$
- $S_g$ is the solubility of the gas.
- $k$ is the Henry’s law constant for that gas in that solvent.
- $P_g$ is the partial pressure of the gas above the liquid.
### Temperature
- Generally, the solubility of most solid solutes in liquid solvents *increases* with increasing temperature.
- However, a few solids containing ions that are extensively hydrated in water, such as lithium carbonate, are less soluble at high temperatures.
![[Pasted image 20231218161411.png]]
- For the *gasses*, opposite is true. Higher temperature drives gases out of solution.
![[Pasted image 20231218161504.png]]
### Concentration
Concentration of a solution gives us simply how much solute are inside the solvent.
There are more than one way to express it:
- Mass percent:
	- $g$ solute in $100g$ solution
 - Volume percent:
	 - $ml$ solute in $100ml$ solution
  - Molarity $(M)$:
	- Solute moles in $1$ liter solution.
 - Molality $(m)$:
	 - Solute moles in $1000g$ solvent.
  - Mole fraction:
	  - $\chi_s = \frac{n}{n+N}$
	  - $n \to$ Solute moles
	  - $N \to$ Solvent moles
### Colligative Properties
Some properties of the solution depend on the amount of the solute and of the solvent and are independent of the type of solute. These properties are called *colligative properties*.
The most important colligative properties are:
- Vapour pressure lowering
- Boiling point elevation
- Freezing point depression
- Osmotic pressure
**NOTE:** Laws regulating colligative properties are different for *electrolyte* and *non electrolyte*.
#### Ideal Solution
1) The solution is diluted.
2) The vapor pressure of the solute is negligible compared to that of the solvent.
3) The solute does not bond to the solute and does not dissociate.
4) The solute does not react with the solvent.
Real solutions are approximately ideal at concentrations below:
- $0.1m$ for *non-electrolyte* solutions.
- $0.01m$ for *electrolyte* solutions.

#### Vapour Pressure Lowering
![[Pasted image 20231218165713.png]]
#### Boiling Point Elevation
![[Pasted image 20231218165740.png]]
#### Freezing Point Depression
![[Pasted image 20231218165759.png]]
#### Osmotic Pressure $(\pi)$
$$
\pi = MRT
$$
- $M \to$ Molarity
- $R \to$ Gas Constant
- $T \to$ Temperature (in $K$)
![[Pasted image 20231218170722.png]]
#### Electrolytic Solutions
So far all of the colligative property formulas that we obtain was for *non-electrolyte* solutions.
To make them work for *electrolyte* solutions we need to adjust them.

**NOTE:** $HF$ and $CH_3CO_2H$ are the only *weak electrolytes* other electrolytes are *strong*.
##### Dissociation Degree $(\alpha)$
$$
\alpha = \frac{c_{diss}}{c_{init}} \cdot 100\%
$$
- For *strong* electrolytes $\to \alpha = 1$ 
- For *weak* electrolytes $\to 0 < \alpha < 1$ 
- For *non-electrolytes* $\to \alpha = 0$
##### Number of Produced Ions $(z)$
Number of ions produced by the dissociation of one molecule or formula unit.
![[Pasted image 20231218172011.png]]
##### The Van’t Hoff Coefficient $(i)$
$$
i = 1 + \alpha(z-1)
$$
So, the important thing is *The Van't Hoff Coefficient*.
For colligative property formulas to work for electrolytes we need to multiply them with the $i$:
- $P =p \degree - p \degree(ni/(ni+N))$
- $\Delta T_{eb} = k_{eb}mi$
- $\Delta T_{cr} = k_{cr}mi$
- $\pi = MRTi$
