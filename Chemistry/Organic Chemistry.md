## Hydrocarbons
### General Properties
- Hydrocarbons contain only $C$  and $H$ atoms.
- They are insoluble in water. So they don't have polar bonds.
### Alkanes (Paraffins)
- *Saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons* are called alkanes
- They only contain $C - C$ single bonds.
- They have the general formula of: $C_nH_{2n+2}$
- Very *unreactive*
- The dominant interaction between alkane molecules is the *London Force*.
- *Longer chains* tend to have: Higher melting points, higher boiling points and higher enthalpies of vaporization.
- *Unbranched chains* also tend to have: Higher melting points, higher boiling points and higher enthalpies of vaporization.

**NOTE:** Saturated means every carbon is surrounded with hydrogen atoms. Unsaturated means all the carbons are not surrounded with hydrogen atoms.
#### Cycloalkanes
- They are alkanes but instead of forming a chain, they form a ring.
- They only contain $C - C$ single bonds.
- They have the general formula of: $C_nH_{2n}$

### Alkenes (Olefins)
- They are one of the *unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons* the other one being alkynes.
- They contain at least one $C = C$ double bond.
- They have the general formula of: $C_nH_{2n}$
- Much more *reactive* than alkanes.
- *Polyunsaturated*: More than one $C = C$ double bond.
### Alkynes (Acetylenes)
- They are one of the *unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons* the other one being alkenes.
- They contain at least one $C \equiv C$ triple bond.
- They have the general formula of: $C_nH_{2n-2}$
- More *reactive* than alkenes.
### Aromatic Hydrocarbons
- They contain *benzene ring structure*.
- Even though they are often drawn with $C = C$, they don't behave like alkenes.
### Isomerism
When we have different molecules with the same molecular formula, we call them Isomers.
#### Structural Isomers
![[Pasted image 20231216175549.png]]
Possible structural isomers you can get increases when there are more atoms in the molecular formula.

| n | Number of isomers |
|:---:|:-----------------:|
| 1 | 1                 |
| 2 | 1                 |
| 3 | 1                 |
| 4 | 2                 |
| 5 | 3                 |
| 6 | 5                 |
#### Stereoisomers
Stereoisomers are different molecules whose atoms are connected in the same order, but have a different spatial direction.
##### Optical Isomers
Optical isomers are molecules that are *non-superimposable* mirror images of each other
![[Pasted image 20231216180739.png]]
- Any molecule with a non-superimposable mirror image is said to be *chiral*.
- Any carbon with 4 different substituents will be a *chiral center*.
- A pair of non-superimposable mirror images are called a pair of *enantiomers*.
##### Geometric Isomers
Because the rotation around a *double bond* is highly restricted, you will have different molecules if groups have different spatial orientation about the double bond
- This is often called *cis-trans isomerism*.
- When groups on the doubly bonded carbons are cis, they are on the same side
- When groups on the doubly bonded carbons are trans, they are on opposite sides

### Naming Hydrocarbons (!!!)
Naming organic compounds is a huge part of Organic Chemistry and you can find lots of sources about it on the internet.
## Functional Groups
Functional groups are other organic compounds are hydrocarbons in which functional groups have been substituted for hydrogens.
![[Pasted image 20231216182428.png]]
Most important functional groups for this class are:
- Haloalkanes
- Alcohol
- Ether
- Amine
- Carboxylic Acid
### Haloalkanes (Alkyl Halides)
Haloalkanes are simply alkanes with at least one $H$ atom replaced with an Halogen atom.
- Although they have important uses, many haloalkanes are *highly toxic* and a threat to the environment.

### Alcohols
- $R - OH$ is their general formula.
- *Ethanol* $(CH_3CH_2OH)$ is what is used on alcoholic beverages.
- *Isopropyl Alcohol* $((CH_3)_2CHOH)$ is a poisonous alcohol that is mostly used for cleaning. 
- *Methanol* $(CH_3OH)$ is another poisonous alcohol that is known as wood alcohol.
**NOTE:** Proof number of an alcohol simply means 2 times of percentage of alcohol.

**Important Thing To Know:**
Alcohols are divided into three classes according to the number of organic groups attached to the carbon atom connected to the $-OH$ group:

### Ethers
- $R - O - R$ is their general formula.
- To name ethers, name each alkyl group attached to the O, then add the word ether to the end.
- Ethers are *not very reactive*. They are more *volatile* than alcohols with similar molar masses because their molecules cannot form hydrogen bonds with one another.
### Carbonyl Group
$C = O$ we call this bond carbonyl group.
![[Pasted image 20231216185533.png]]
### Aldehydes and Ketones
![[Pasted image 20231216185758.png]]
- They contain the *carbonyl group*.
- Aldehydes have at least 1 $H$ atom linked to the carbonyl group.
- Ketones have carbon chains on the both side of their carbonyl group.
- Many aldehydes and ketones have *pleasant tastes and aromas*.
- Formaldehyde $(H_2C=O)$
- Acetone $(CH_3C(=O)CH_3)$
### Carboxylic Acid
- $RCOOH$ is their general formula.
- They have a *sour taste*.
- They are *weak acids*.
- Citric acid, Acetic Acid, Formic acid are some examples of carboxylic acids.
- When naming the compounds if you have a carboxylic acid present, that means that has the *highest priority* and you should name your compound according to the carboxylic acid functional group.
- Name obtained by replacing the ending with -oic acid. Note: the carbon atom of the carboxylic group is included in the count of carbon atoms.

### Esters
- $R - COO - R$ is their general formula.
- They have a *sweet odor*.
- They are made by reacting carboxylic acid with an alcohol *(esterification)*.

### Amines
- $N$ containing organic molecules.
- *Very bad smelling*.
- They are formed when *proteins decompose*.
- Organic bases.
![[Pasted image 20231216191643.png]]

**Important Thing To Know:**
Amines are classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary according to the number of R groups on the nitrogen atom.

### Aminoacids
An amino acid is a carboxylic acid that contains an amino group as well as a carboxyl group.
