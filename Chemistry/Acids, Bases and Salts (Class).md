## Arhenius Theory
An acid ionize in water: $HCl \to H^+ + Cl^-$
A base dissociate in water: $NaOH \to Na^+ + OH^-$
This theory can't explain: $NH_3, CO_3^{2-},...$

Since $H^+$ is very reactive it immediately reacts with water to form $H_3O^+$
## Bronsted-Lowry Theory
**NOTE:** This is the theory that we're mostly responsible from.
Acid $\to$ *proton* donor
Base $\to$ *proton* acceptor
**NOTE:** Since water accepts a $H^+$ in this theory water is defined as a base.

General acid base reaction:
$$
AH + B \rightleftarrows A^- + BH^+
$$
$AH \to$ acid
$B \to$ base
$A^- \to$ conjugate base
$BH^+ \to$ conjugate base

Acid Example:
$$
HCl + H_2O \to H_3O^+ + Cl^-
$$
Base Example:
$$
NH_3 + H_2O \rightleftarrows NH_4^+ + OH^-
$$
**NOTE:** Here the water acts as an acid.
**NOTE:** acid $\to$ conjugate base and base $\to$ conjugate acid, in this theory.

Strong acids:
$$
HA + H_2O \to H_3O^+ + A^-
$$
for strong acids: $[HA]_{initive} = [H_3O^+]$

Weak acids:
$$
HA + H_2O \leftrightarrows H_3O^+ + A^-
$$
for weak acids: $K_a = \frac{[A^-]_{eq} \cdot [H_3O^+]_{eq}}{[HA]_{eq}}$
so: $[HA]_{initive} \neq [H_3O^+]_{eq}$

**NOTE:** Phenol is an important alcohol because normally alcohols can't change pH but Phenol can.
### Strength of oxoacids
- $Cl - O - H$
- $Br-O-H$
- $I - O - H$
Because the $Cl$ pulls $O$ stronger than the others. The bond $O - H$ will be weaker. So $Cl - O - H$ is the weakest/strongest? out of these three. The electronegativity of what is attached to $OH$ is important.
Also when the oxidation number increases because of the same principle the acid stregthens.

Comparing ethanol and acetic acid. The single $O$ in the acetic acid is very important for making acetic acid weak acid and ethanol not an acid.
**We can get a Theory Question out of this**
### Bases
Strong base:
$$
NaOH + H_2O \to Na^+ + OH^- + H_2O
$$
Here $NaOH$ is not the base but contains the base $OH^-$.
So:
$OH^- \to$ base
$H_2O \to$ acid
$H_2O \to$ conjugated acid
$OH^- \to$ conjugated base
So this is simply:
$$
OH^- + H_2O \to OH^- + H_2O
$$
for strong bases: $[NaOH]_{in} = [OH^-]$

Weak base:
$$
B + H_2O \leftrightarrows BH^+ + OH^-
$$
for weak bases: $K_b = \frac{[BH^+]_{eq}\cdot [OH^-]_{eq}}{[B]_{eq}}$

So out of all of these we can say Strong acids give negligible conjugate bases, weaks give weak, negligibles give strong. Same applies to bases.
## Lewis Theory
Lewis acids are electron pair acceptors.
Lewis bases are electron pair donors.

In lewis theory some acids are not acids but contains the acid $H^+$ just like the base version of Bronsted-Lowry Theorem.
